# Redirector_Config

.json files for libre frontend redirection of websites with use with the Redirector[https://github.com/einaregilsson/Redirector] extension. I personally prefer this extension over LibRedirect for more granular control.

Destination websites of redirections are not maintained by me, and **breakage/lag can occur**. Disable/edit redirections as and when needed.
