# Redirector_Config

.json files for use with the [Redirector](https://github.com/einaregilsson/Redirector) extension. I personally prefer this extension over LibRedirect for more granular control.

Destination websites of redirections:
1. Do not require an additional account to access content.
1. May or may not be FOSS or privacy respecting frontends.
2. Are not maintained by me, and **breakage/lag can occur**. Disable/edit redirections as and when needed.
